        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I’m Keonho Wang, a passionate software engineering student with
          a keen interest in frontend development. My journey in programming
          began with a curiosity about how websites are built and has since
          evolved into a dedication to creating dynamic and engaging user
          interfaces. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m
          continuously exploring the latest technologies and frameworks like
          React and Vue.js to enhance my skill set. I thrive on translating
          creative designs into functional and aesthetically pleasing web
          applications. My goal is to build intuitive and responsive interfaces
          that provide a seamless user experience. Currently, I’m honing my
          skills through various projects and coursework, aiming to contribute
          to innovative and impactful web solutions. I’m always excited to learn
          new things and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for
          technology and design., I strive to build user-friendly and dynamic
          experiences.
